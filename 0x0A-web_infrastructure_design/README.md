### What you should learn from this project

- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
- You must be able to explain what are each component doing
- You must be able to explain system redundancy
- Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

### Requirements:

- For each task, once you are done whiteboarding (on a whiteboard, piece of paper or software or your choice), take a picture/screenshot of your diagram
- This project will be manually reviewed:
  1. As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
  2. Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
  3. For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
  4. After pushing your answer file to Github, insert the Github file link into the URL box
- You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
