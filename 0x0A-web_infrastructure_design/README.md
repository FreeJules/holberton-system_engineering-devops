- This project will be manually reviewed:
  1. As each task is completed, the name of that task will turn green
  2. Upload a screenshot, showing that you completed the required levels, to any image hosting service (I personally use imgur but feel free to use anything you want).
  3. For the following tasks, insert the link from of your screenshot into the answer file
  4. After pushing your answer file to Github, insert the Github file link into the URL box
- You will also have to whiteboard each task in front of a mentor, staff or student - no computer or notes will be allowed during the whiteboarding session
